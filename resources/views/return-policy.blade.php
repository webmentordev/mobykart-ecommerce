            <h2>Eligibility for Returns</h2>
            <p>Items are eligible for return under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damaged During Shipping:</strong> If your item arrives damaged due to shipping, you may return it for a replacement or refund.</li>
                <li><strong>Defective Product:</strong> If the item you received is defective, you may return it for a replacement or refund.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong Product:</strong> If you received a product different from what you ordered, you may return it for a replacement or refund.</li>
                <li>Please note that items are not eligible for return if they are damaged by the customer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Return Process</h2>
            <p>To initiate a return, please follow these steps:</p>

Include your order number, a description of the issue, and any relevant photos of the damaged, defective, or incorrect item.</li>
                <li><strong>Return Authorization:</strong> Our customer service team will review your request and, if eligible, provide you with a Return Authorization Number (RAN) and return instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Packaging and Shipping:</strong> Securely package the item in its original packaging, including all accessories, manuals, and documentation. Clearly write the RAN on the outside of the package. Ship the item back to the address provided by our customer service team.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Refunds and Replacements</h2>
            <p>Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund or replacement.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Refunds: If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will be applied to your original method of payment within 7-10 business days.</li>
